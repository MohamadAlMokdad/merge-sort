# 🔀 Merge Sort

This Python function implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges the two sorted halves back together.

## 📜 Function: `merge_sort`

### 📝 Description
The `merge_sort` function recursively divides the array into two halves until each half has only one element. It then merges the halves in sorted order by comparing the smallest elements from each half. The function continues merging and sorting until the entire array is sorted.

# Sample array
arr = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

# Expected output:
# Sorted array using Merge Sort: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
